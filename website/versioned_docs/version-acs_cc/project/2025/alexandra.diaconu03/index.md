## Description

The project consists of an implementation of the famous game 2048. The goal of the game is to reach the value 2048 by combining powers of 2 on a 4x4 board (classic mode). The player combines numbered tiles by moving up, down, left and right, using physical buttons. The game runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and is displayed on a color LCD.

+ The system utilizes five buttons for the gameplay: up, down, left, right and reset.

+ The LCD screen showcases the grid and the numbered tiles.

+ A buzzer that makes a sound when a milestone is reached.

## Motivation

As a kid, I loved playing simple, clever games like 2048, fascinated by how such a basic concept could be so addictive and satisfying. That experience stuck with me and inspired this project: **building my own version of 2048 from scratch.**

While planning the system — from managing inputs to handling graphics and game logic — I realized it’s more than just code. It’s also about creating a smooth, engaging experience, which taps into my love for design and user interaction.

## Architecture 
The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** serves as the central control unit, directing and managing all other components utilized within the project.

The **LCD** serves as an interface for showcasing the grid and numbered tiles, it is connected to the Pico through SPI

The **buttons** act as the primary input method, they are connected directly to the Pico's GPIO pins

The **buzzer** emits sound cues for actions and is connected to a GPIO pin

Performed integrated testing of all components working together.

Initiated development of the core game logic.

Updated project documentation to reflect the final hardware schematic.

### Week 19–25 May
Achieved significant progress in implementing the game logic.

Identified and resolved several logic-related issues.

Enhanced documentation by including a list and explanation of the libraries utilized in the project.

## Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**:
- **Purpose**: Controls all components.
- **Function**: Acts as the main controller, coordinating the operations of buttons, buzzer, and the LCD display.

2. **LCD Display**:
- **Purpose**: Displays the grid and numbered tiles of the 2048 game.
- **Function**: Provides a visual interface for the user, updating the display dynamically as the user moves the tiles and merges them.

3. **Buttons**:
- **Purpose**: Serve as the user input method for controlling the game.
- **Function**: Allow the player to move tiles in four directions (Up, Down, Left, Right) and reset the game.

4. **Buzzer**:
- **Purpose**: Provide auditory feedback during gameplay.
- **Function**: Emits sound cues for actions such as tile merges, successful moves, or game over.
