## Description

Intelicar is a remote-controlled car operated via a smartphone using Internet. It is equipped with sensors on to detect nearby objects. If the car gets too close to an obstacle, the buzzer is activated as a warning.


## Motivation

I've always been passionate about cars, and I wanted to dive deeper into how some of the systems we use every day as drivers actually work. This project gave me the chance to explore that by building a miniature version of a car with real-world features like obstacle detection, motor control, and speed sensing. It's a hands-on way to show how useful and important these systems are-not just in big commercial vehicles, but even in small embedded systems. It's all about turning curiosity into something real and practical.


## Architecture 

### Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
- **Purpose**: Central controller  
- **Function**: Manages and coordinates all components in the system, including sensors, motor driver, buzzer, and motors. Runs the core logic for movement control and obstacle detection.

### L298N Motor Driver
- **Purpose**: Motor control interface  
- **Function**: Controls the speed and direction of the DC motors based on signals from the Pico. Enables forward, backward, and turning motion.

### DC Motors
- **Purpose**: Provide mobility  
- **Function**: Drive the car by rotating wheels in desired directions. Operate independently or together to enable turning and directional control.

### U-Shape Photoelectric Sensor
- **Purpose**: Speed measurement  
- **Function**: Detects motor rotation (RPM) by sensing interruptions in the beam. Sends feedback to the Pico for precise motor control.

### HC-SR04P Ultrasonic Sensors
- **Purpose**: Obstacle detection  
- **Function**: Measure distance to nearby objects by emitting ultrasonic pulses and timing the echoes. Used to avoid collisions and trigger the buzzer.

### Buzzer
- **Purpose**: Warning system  
- **Function**: Emits a sound when an obstacle is detected within a certain range. Alerts the user of potential collisions.

## Log

### Week 28 - 4 May
Gathered all my parts for the car.
### Week 5 - 11 May
Started working on the code for the car. Connected it to the laptop over internet and worked a little bit on the motor setup.
### Week 12 - 18 May
I implemented the sensor in the code. Connected everything. Now i only need the chassis for the car .

### Week 19 - 25 May
Finnished motor logic, now when the car gets close to an obstacle it will stop and emit sound.

### Week 26 - 30 May
Refined the motor logic, the car now gets commands from the laptop and runs them. I can move the car and change the speed of the motors. I added 2 more sensors for better object detection at the front of the car.
